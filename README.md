# Fire Emblem: Ankoku Ryu to Hikari no Tsurugi

This is a disassembly of Fire Emblem: Ankoku Ryu to Hikari no Tsurugi, also known as Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light. It is the first installment in the Fire Emblem series.

It builds the following ROM:

- **fe1.nes** `sha1: 0179c550d424e0397496078789e7b116601d120c`

## Setting up

- You will need to be under some kind of Unix/Linux system (on Windows 10, try out WSL).
- You will also need to have a copy of the original ROM in the repository directory, named `fe1-base.nes`.

- install the CC65 suite. It is a package on Debian based systems (such as Ubuntu).
- Once that is done, you should be able to build the project by using `make`.

## Notes

Not all of the ROM has been dumped into ASM files yet, which is why the original ROM is still required for building the project.

Most of the data, even if dumped, is in the form of raw lists of bytes.
